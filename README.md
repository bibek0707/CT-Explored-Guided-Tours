CT Explored: Guided Tours

Developed in partnership with CT Explored Inc.


🎯 Project Overview

CT Explored: Guided Tours is a cross-platform mobile app that connects users to curated historical and cultural tours across Connecticut. Built with React Native (Expo), the app allows users to explore interactive maps, view detailed information about Points of Interest (POIs), and engage with a gamified Instagram-based leaderboard.

The backend is powered by Supabase for authentication and data storage, while integrations with the Instagram Graph API, Apple Developer Console, and Google Play Console support media sharing, login, and publishing.
